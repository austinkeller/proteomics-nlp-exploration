# proteomics nlp exploration

Exploring classification of proteomics literature and repository metadata using NLP

## Getting started
First, [install the Docker client](http://docs.docker.com) for your system.

Then, in a terminal, change to the project directory (the one containing this file) and:

- Test the installation using `docker info`
- Run `python build.py` to download data and run any preprocessing steps
- Start the notebook container by running `sh start_notebook.sh` from this directory

Now your notebook server is running! Open a browser and point to `http://localhost`. Next,

- Enter the password token displayed on the terminal
- Click on `notebook.ipynb` to open
- If you're accessing a finished notebook, you can browse, edit the code, and execute the cells to reproduce or alter the figures.
- If you're starting a new notebook, read the project guidelines in the notebook and start coding!
